Design Pattern Implementation-

Jacob Orlando: Observer & Tabs

Observer- My design pattern was implemented through the button listeners throughout the User Interface classes in the application. The button listeners act as observers for the button objects, and notify of state changes and perform logic based on the changed state (button press).

Tabs- My user interface pattern was implemented in the User Profile screen. The tabs along the top of the screen allow the user to quickly switch through different functionalities of the user profile interface.
